### Basic Setup

/security enable feature:Ban Protection

# Set punishment to kick
/security punishment feature:Ban Protection punishment:Kick User

# Set max violations to 3
/security maxviolations feature:Ban Protection max_violations:3

# Add trusted role to whitelist
/securitywhitelist add feature:Ban Protection type:Role target:@TrustedRole

# Set logs channel
/security logs channel:#security-logs
```

### Advanced Configuration

```bash
# Enable multiple protections
/security enable feature:Ban Protection
/security enable feature:Kick Protection
/security enable feature:Channel Create Protection

# Set different punishments
/security punishment feature:Ban Protection punishment:Ban User
/security punishment feature:Kick Protection punishment:Kick User
/security punishment feature:Channel Create Protection punishment:Clear Roles

# Set different limits
/security maxviolations feature:Ban Protection max_violations:1
/security maxviolations feature:Kick Protection max_violations:3
/security maxviolations feature:Channel Create Protection max_violations:5
```

### Violation Management

```bash
# Check user violations
/securityviolations view user:@username

# Check specific feature violations
/securityviolations view user:@username feature:Ban Protection

# Reset all violations for user
/securityviolations reset user:@username

# Reset specific feature violations
/securityviolations reset user:@username feature:Ban Protection

# View top violators
/securityviolations top limit:10
```

### Whitelist Management

```bash
# Add member to whitelist
/securitywhitelist add feature:Ban Protection type:Member target:@username

# Add role to whitelist
/securitywhitelist add feature:Ban Protection type:Role target:@ModeratorRole

# View whitelist
/securitywhitelist list feature:Ban Protection

# Remove from whitelist
/securitywhitelist remove feature:Ban Protection target:@username

# Clear all whitelists
/securitywhitelist clear feature:Ban Protection
```

## Command Permissions

All security slash commands require **Administrator** permissions. This ensures only server administrators can modify security settings.

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Essential Protections
```bash
# Enable core protections first
/security enable feature:Ban Protection
/security enable feature:Kick Protection
/security enable feature:Role Delete Protection
```

### 2. Set Appropriate Punishments
```bash
# Use strict punishments for critical actions
/security punishment feature:Ban Protection punishment:Ban User
/security punishment feature:Role Delete Protection punishment:Ban User

# Use moderate punishments for less critical actions
/security punishment feature:Channel Create Protection punishment:Clear Roles
```

### 3. Configure Whitelists
```bash
# Add trusted roles and members
/securitywhitelist add feature:Ban Protection type:Role target:@AdminRole
/securitywhitelist add feature:Ban Protection type:Member target:@TrustedUser
```

### 4. Set Up Logging
```bash
# Create a security logs channel and set it
/security logs channel:#security-logs
```

### 5. Monitor Violations
```bash
# Regularly check for violations
/securityviolations top limit:10

# Review specific users
/securityviolations view user:@suspicious_user
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Commands not appearing**
   - Ensure bot has Administrator permissions
   - Check if slash commands are registered globally
   - Restart the bot to reload commands

2. **Permission errors**
   - Verify bot has necessary permissions
   - Check role hierarchy (bot's role must be above managed roles)

3. **Whitelist not working**
   - Ensure target user/role exists
   - Check if feature is enabled
   - Verify whitelist was added correctly

4. **Violations not tracking**
   - Check if feature is enabled
   - Verify logs channel is set
   - Ensure bot has permissions to view audit logs

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check current status
/security status

# View all violations
/securityviolations top limit:20

# Check specific user
/securityviolations view user:@username
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Bot Permissions**: Ensure the bot has all necessary permissions
2. **Role Hierarchy**: Bot's highest role must be above roles it manages
3. **Whitelist Management**: Regularly review and update whitelists
4. **Log Monitoring**: Monitor security logs for false positives
5. **Testing**: Test security features in a controlled environment first

## Integration with Events

The slash commands work with the security event system. When events are triggered:

1. **Violation Check**: System checks if user is whitelisted
2. **Violation Recording**: If not whitelisted, violation is recorded
3. **Punishment Application**: If max violations reached, punishment is applied
4. **Logging**: All actions are logged to the configured channel

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for the slash command system:

1. **Bulk Operations**: Enable/disable multiple features at once
2. **Preset Configurations**: Quick setup for common security levels
3. **Advanced Filtering**: More detailed violation filtering and reporting
4. **Automated Responses**: Custom automated responses for violations
5. **Integration**: Integration with other moderation systems
